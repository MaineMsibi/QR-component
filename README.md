The challenge has refreshing my memory on basic HTML and learning new CSS properties has been a rewarding experience. Revisiting the fundamentals of HTML has reinforced my understanding of structure and semantics, while exploring modern CSS techniques has opened up new possibilities for design and layout. This process has not only expanded my skill set but also boosted my confidence in web development.I now feel more equipped to create visually appealing and responsive websites.
